# August 17

* compare variance/se at a freq (from M=100)
- YOU'll need to put the c estimate INSIDE the loop, or use apply to the FULL dataset
* ch 4: investigating how to make the block size adaptive: if B is a fn of time.
    * small B in center for instance, then large B at edges?
* compare to Azadeh
- CBC for stationary -> column average -> compare to multitaper
- see how this works for 1 simulation
* look up how to only get eigenvec corresponding 1st eigenvalue or largest eigenvalue 
- estimate c, get residual estimate of S_Y, outer product should be smooth now
* do a gump

* after propsp, look up LINPACK and how to use different eigens 

#### Skye's Wishlist

* fix code for large lattice of g est plots
* renaming convention involving "rev" factor
* get data for B=400 NOT rev

#### Results so far

* Got g estimates directly from sims (not mean of sims)
* Plots for new g estimates
    - BC looks a bit better than CBC, now :(
* smoothed BC and CBC by taking outer product of g est and colmeans
    - this works for UMPs!!
    - Honestly CBC looks a bit better than BC :) for M=100
    - for M=1... Honestly BC is better whatever but it WORKS
    
#### Things to bring up in next meeting

* standard error of $\tilde g$ is very small

# August 24

* Alternative estimate of Y(t): x(t)/c(t) (don't use TFS, that's where you got stuck w indeces)
    * this est might be better for detecting line components present in Y(t)
* iteration: get g-hat from SBC and SCBC using same method to get the g which made those matrices
* compare g to Azadeh's estimate (skye... do you think the panel might ask you if you've done this? Make sure you at least take a look)
* compare TFS colMeans to multitaper of Y. Better in different contexts?

**LITERATURE:** Senay 2018. Figure out BSS (see my current understanding of Glen's summary, below).

* similar to classical stats' "independent component analysis"
* suppose you have two observed series, and each is a lin combo of two subseries/signals
* cross spectra should have 0's off diagonal, assuming the signals are uncorrelated
* Senay diagonalizes the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}S_{xx} & S_{xy} \\ S_{yx} & S_{yy}\end{bmatrix}$ at each $(t,f)$ pair
* corresponding SVD gives us weights (coefs) distinguishing the signals. weights assumed constant over time... what if they changed?
    * two people talking on their own hot mics in the same room, mics picking up signals from both but at different amps
    * what if the people moved around so those amps changed - p1 steps away from mic towards p2, etc. 
    * brainwaves probably do this to electrodes

**PAPER SUBMISSION**  
ICASP: write up a paper on chapter 3 results for next week. Look at Azadeh's SSP for inspo. Cite Percy-Waldy 20' for multitaper.

#### Skye's Wishlist

* create a figure showing results for the Azadeh method of getting g
    * show negatives?
    * show U1 and V1?
- get smoothed BC/CBC for AR(2), compare to multitaper
* get y(t) from x(t)/c(t), multitaper, and compare to true psd
* go through *Plotter_1.Rmd* and switch `lines()` to `sadd()` 
* create BC/CBC for a gump

#### Results so far

* Azadeh's method works perfectly for the theoretical TFS, but somehow is negative when taken from the BC and/or CBC
* colmeans work well for mean of 100 sims, undershoot a bit I think tho
* UM... REALLY GOOD RESULTS FOR M=1 like wtf good
