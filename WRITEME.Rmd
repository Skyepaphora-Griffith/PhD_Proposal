## August 17

* compare variance/se at a freq (from M=100)
* YOU'll need to put the c estimate INSIDE the loop, or use apply to the FULL dataset
* ch 4: investigating how to make the block size adaptive: if B is a fn of time.
    - small B in center for instance, then large B at edges?
* compare to Azadeh
* CBC for stationary -> column average -> compare to multitaper
* see how this works for 1 simulation
* look up how to only get eigenvec corresponding 1st eigenvalue or largest eigenvalue 
* estimate c, get residual estimate of S_Y, outer product should be smooth now
* do a gump

* after propsp, look up LINPACK and how to use different eigens 

#### Skye's Wishlist

* fix code for large lattice of g est plots
* renaming convention involving "rev" factor
* get data for B=400 NOT rev

#### Results so far

* Got g estimates directly from sims (not mean of sims)
* Plots for new g estimates
    - BC looks a bit better than CBC, now :(
* smoothed BC and CBC by taking outer product of g est and colmeans
    - this works for UMPs!!
    - Honestly CBC looks a bit better than BC :) for M=100
    - for M=1... Honestly BC is better whatever but it WORKS
    
#### Things to bring up

* standard error of $\tilde g$ is very small
